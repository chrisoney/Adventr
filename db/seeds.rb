Whatever outlandish stories you've heard of his power, they are true. He holds dominion over vast armies of the undead. He controlls myriad demons and devils. His personal magicks are varied and powerful. If you set eyes on him, you will likely die soonafter.\nNext, two common enemies. The first are bone wurms, those undead vessels within which the Undead King transports his soldiers. Not much can be done to penetrate their defenses. Overwhelming force is the key here.\nNext we have the Revenants. Their power varies as it is tied to who they were when they were alive. The only constant is that they are far and above the standard skeleton you face. Be wary and rely on your comrades against them.", quest_type: "image", user_id: catherine.id)
